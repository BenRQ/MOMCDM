quest.name,Chapeldown Manor
quest.description,"On top of the hill stands an old manor with a chapel connecting to it. It once served as an inn but has been abandoned since the mysterious disappearance of the owner and all his resident guests. There are rumours of ghosts haunting this manor and recent stories of students disappearing while playing a dare to stay the night at Chapeldown Manor. \n\nThis scenario requires investigators to uncover the truth about the disappearences and prevent this from ever happening again before time runs out.\n\nNote: this scenario randomly selects a storyline out of 5 possible storylines and is played in a randomly selected mansion (2 possible layouts).\n\n<i>A scenario for Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition.\nThis scenario uses tiles from the expansion ""Streets of Arkham""</i>"

UIIntroductionText.uitext,"<i>""The rumours about Chapeldown Manor MUST be true""</i> the female voice had said on the telephone. The voice belonged to Elli Horrowitz, a friend of mine. Convinced of the existense of the occult since the last investigation we did together. \n\nShe had been researching ghost stories and scanning newspapers, searching for more proof. <i>""I will go to Chapeldown Manor just before 22:00. According to my reseach it is the time  that the ghost will appear. Are you comming too? It will be like old times, you and me together hunting ghost"".</i> She sounded so exited, but this was not the first time we had chased a wild goose. I should have said yes.\n\n This was 3 days ago and the last time that I heard from her. Is she angy with me or did she vanish like all the stories that surround this manor suggest? She is not answering her phone and hasn't been seen at her appartment lately. I'd better check out the manor. What if she was right....\n\n "
