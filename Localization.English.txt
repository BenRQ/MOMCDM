quest.name,Chapeldown Manor
quest.description,"On top of the hill stands an old manor with a chapel connecting to it. It once served as an inn but has been abandoned since the mysterious disappearance of the owner and all his resident guests. There are rumors of ghosts haunting this manor and recent stories of students disappearing while playing a dare to stay the night at Chapeldown Manor. \n\nThis scenario requires investigators to uncover the truth about the disappearances and prevent this from ever happening again before time runs out.\n\n<i><b>Note:</b></i> this scenario randomly selects a story line out of 5 possible story lines and is played in a randomly selected mansion (2 possible layouts).\n\n<i>A scenario for Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition.\nThis scenario uses tiles from the expansion ""Streets of Arkham""</i>"
